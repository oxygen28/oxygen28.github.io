## About Me
Hi, I'm oxygen — a Blue Teamer with a passion for DFIR and Malware Analysis. I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to protect systems from evolving threats. Whether it’s investigating incidents, analyzing malware, or fortifying defenses, I love solving complex puzzles and uncovering the truth behind cyberattacks.

I'm a lifelong learner, always eager to expand my knowledge and sharpen my skills. While I'm still growing in the field of DFIR, I embrace every opportunity to learn and improve.
